NOTES TO YOU:

.codekit-config ?
      Don't worry about the .codekit-config or cache folder, Brandon uses it only for running a local server and seeing results update in the browser. Nothing is compiled with it, compiling less and js is done by using the grunt file in /bootstrap.


When adding: Make sure the style.less file references the bootstrap variables and mixens




TODO:


Evaluate if bui should even be compiled with bootstrap.. or just added as a sepperate css file. It could reference bootstraps variables and mixens.


Need prefix on bootstrap overrides in _variables

Define the use of esc key to exit modals.
