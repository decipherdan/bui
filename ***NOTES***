NOTES TO YOU:
Don't worry about the .codekit-config or cache folder, Brandon uses it only for running a local server and seeing results update in the browser. Nothing is compiled with it, compiling less and js is done by using the grunt file in /bootstrap.






TODO:

Buttons - link buttons need to look more disabled when they are so.

Need prefix on bootstrap overrides in _variables
