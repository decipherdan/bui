NOTES TO YOU:

.codekit-config ?
      Don't worry about the .codekit-config or cache folder, Brandon uses it only for running a local server and seeing results update in the browser. Nothing is compiled with it, compiling less and js is done by using the grunt file in /bootstrap.







/////// customize modal animations (in bui's _modal.less).

TODO:

Need prefix on bootstrap overrides in _variables
