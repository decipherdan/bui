NOTES TO YOU:

.codekit-config ?
      Don't worry about the .codekit-config or cache folder, Brandon uses it only for running a local server and seeing results update in the browser. Nothing is compiled with it, compiling less and js is done by using the grunt file in /bootstrap.


When editing: Make sure the style.less file references the bootstrap variables and mixens




TODO:


Get Seth's help - extend the bs tooltip and popover functions to allow for data-learn-more="http://learnMoreLink"


Make example of disabled toggle button

Need prefix on bootstrap overrides in _variables

Define the use of esc key to exit modals.
