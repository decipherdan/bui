NOTES TO YOU:

.codekit-config ?
      Don't worry about the .codekit-config or cache folder, Brandon uses it only for running a local server and seeing results update in the browser. Nothing is compiled with it, compiling less and js is done by using the grunt file in /bootstrap.







/////// customize modal animations (in bui's _modal.less).

TODO:


"everything" toggle is revealing a fullscreen bg div.


Add Grunt File: 
Gregs grunt file: https://github.com/ggoforth/pencilem/blob/master/Gruntfile.js
// spawning another grunt file
grunt.registerTask('run-grunt', function () {
    var done = this.async();
    grunt.util.spawn({
        grunt: true,
        args: [''],
        opts: {
            cwd: 'app/components/jquery'
        }
    }, function (err, result, code) {
        done();
    });
});


Evaluate if bui should even be compiled with bootstrap.. or just added as a sepperate css file. It could reference bootstraps variables and mixens.


Need prefix on bootstrap overrides in _variables

Define the use of esc key to exit modals.
