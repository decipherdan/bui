NOTES TO YOU:
Don't worry about the .codekit-config or cache folder, Brandon uses it only for running a local server and seeing results update in the browser. Nothing is compiled with it, compiling less and js is done by using the grunt file in /bootstrap.






TODO:

Need a base 12 col bootstrap grid, then a prefix override 24 col bootstrap grid.

update btn class names (like btn-lg) to be in line with bootstrap




BRANDON'S SCRAP NOTES:

You can create a simple task that spawns grunt in the folder you want:

grunt.registerTask('run-grunt', function () {
    var done = this.async();
    grunt.util.spawn({
        grunt: true,
        args: [''],
        opts: {
            cwd: 'app/components/jquery'
        }
    }, function (err, result, code) {
        done();
    });
});
