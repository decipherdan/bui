#BUI - Beacon User Interface

To add BUI styles to bootstrap, just link to the bui-styles.css file in bui-css. The style overrides have been built using bootstrap 3.1.1.

If adding styles, use the Gruntfile.js in the root of the bui folder to compile less.

BUI is built to be modular. An application can load regular bootstrap, then when ready, adding classes to the ```<html>``` tag will activate the bui style overrides.
